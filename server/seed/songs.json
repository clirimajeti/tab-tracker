Lord, forgive me!\nThings I don't understand\nSometimes I need to be alone\nBitch, don't kill my vibe!\nBitch, don't kill my vibe!\nI can feel your energy from two planets away\nI got my drink, I got my music\nI would share it, but today I'm yelling\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\n\n[Verse 1]\nLook inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich\nLook inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist\nI can feel the changes\nI can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous\nI can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless\nYou don't know what pain is\nHow can I paint this picture\nWhen the color blind is hangin' with you?\nFell on my face and awoke with a scar\nAnother mistake livin' deep in my heart\nWear it on top of my sleeve in a flick\nI can admit that it did look like yours\nWhy you resent every making of this?\nTell me your purpose is petty again\nBut even a small lighter can burn a bridge\nEven a small lighter can burn a bridge"
